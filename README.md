# Experis-jQuery
A simple app made in jQuery that fetches data from the [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/meme/) subreddit and displays info of the top posts. Scrolling to bottom loads additional content.
The jQuery animate function was also used to animate a simple hover effect. Styled with bootstrap.
